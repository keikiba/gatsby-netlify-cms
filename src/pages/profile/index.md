# Topics I am interested in

As seen in these days the demand for proper handlings of big- and streamed data increases. The more complex analytical processings are implemented as services in the backend, the more performance requirement becomes more strict. Where concurrency, performance, safety and scalability will be the keys in the development, the use of a statically typed functional programming language will play more important roles. Further agility and continuity in the development and deployment phases will 
be underpinned by broader orchestration mechanisms.   

### Backend
  - Machine learning in Python
  - Functional programming in Scala

### Infrastructure
  - Container orchestration by Kubernetes
  - Distributed processing through Spark

### Frontend
  - Reactive programming with React + Flux/Redux
