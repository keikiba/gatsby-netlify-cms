## Static Site Generation

- Static Site Generaton by Gatsby
- Responsive design by CSS framework
- Hosted on Netlify, and blog post by Netlify CMS

### Gatsby + Netlify CMS

Since the cooperation of Gatsby and Netlify CMS introduced very impressive easiness in static site creation, I gave my first try. 

Every time I commit source files and push changes to GitHub, it triggers a new build on Netlify. As soon as the build finishes, the commited changes become live on the publishded host. 

    # make sure to install gatsby-cli
    $ npm install -g gatsby-cli

    # clean builds and run local server
    $ gatsby clean
    $ gatsby develop
